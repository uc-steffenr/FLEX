# FLEX: Fuzzy Logic Expressions for jaX 💪 


## Installing with CUDA12
Once you have installed FLEX, if you have an NVIDIA enabled machine, you must use this line to properly install CUDA:

```
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12]"==0.8.2
```

## TODO list
- Add train  method
- Work on mf/rule pruning
- Add example connecting to DNN
